**Differences**

* Not every matrix has eigenvalue decomposition, but every matrix has singular value decomposition

* Eigenvalues may not always be real numbers, but singular values are always non-negative real numbers

* Eigenvectors are not always orthogonal to each other (orthogonal for symmetric matrices), but left (or right) singular vectors are orthogonal to each other

**Similarities**

* Singular values of A are square roots of eigenvalues of $AA^*$ and $A^âˆ—A$, and their eigenvectors are left and right singular vectors, respectively

* Singular values of hermitian matrices are absolute values of eigenvalues, and eigenvectors are singular vectors (up to complex signs)

* This relationship can be used to compute singular values by hand
