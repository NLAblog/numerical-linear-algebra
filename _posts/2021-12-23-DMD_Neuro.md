The human brain is estimated to contain around 86 x 10^9 neurons with each neuron making about 10^3 *synapses* or connections with other neurons. This staggering number of neuronal networks make up an intricate dynamical system. In recent years advancements in technology has caught up to capturing signals and computing on signals from neural activity at much larger scale and speed. This has wide reaching implications in answering critical questions related to neuroscience and motivating treatment for neurological disorders.

Studying of neuronal recordings involves the analysis of dynamic, high dimensional and noisy data. However, it has been observed that neural activity can be described by relatively few distinct patterns that evolve in low dimensional subspaces.

These spatial - temporal patterns can be understood and identified using a modal decomposition algorithm called Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm enables significant reduction in complex measurement and enables the patterns to be projected into coherent structures that can be used to reproduce the dynamic data.

The differentiating factor of DMD from two most widely used methods of signal analysis, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Power Spectral analysis, is that it can characterize coherent patterns across *both* time and space. The property to describe dynamics in the spatial as well as temporal domain is unique to DMD as both PCA and Power Spectral Analysis is not effective in describing at least one of the two domains.



### **Method**

<br/>
For our purposes we will be exploring single channel EEG based DMD. Our data is a 30 second extract of slow wave sleep from one individual at a sampling rate of 100 hz from the F3 channel.

We will be choosing M = 600, (6s) long EEG segments and N=5 snapshots.

The data was shared on by the Postdoctoral researcher
Walker Lab, UC Berkeley, Raphael Vallat on his [blog](https://raphaelvallat.com/bandpower.html#).

For our purposes, $X$ consists of the column vectors, $x_k$ with $k = 1,2...m-1$. Each $x_k$ is the observation across all electrodes at the $k^{th}$ time sample and $X'$ is one time step ahead of $X$.

<b/>

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\boldsymbol{X}=\left[\begin{array}{llll}
\mathbf{x}_{1} & \mathbf{x}_{2} & \ldots & \mathbf{x}_{m-1}
\end{array}\right] \\
\boldsymbol{X'}=\left[\begin{array}{llll}
\mathbf{x}_{2} & \mathbf{x}_{3} & \ldots & \mathbf{x}_{m}
\end{array}\right]
\end{array}
$$


The DMD algorithm was constructed to work well for wide and square matrices with $n \geq m$ as a general rule. However, for this case it can be observed that $m \geq n$ as there are 5 columns representative of a snapshot and 600 rows.

In order to resolve this problem we create an augmented matrix that is inspired by the hankel matrix.

We first create an augmented vector that is obtained by stacking $x_k$ at current time with the copies of x at future times.

$$
\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{aug}}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{x}_{1} \\
\mathbf{x}_{2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{x}_{l}
\end{array}\right]
$$

We then continue to append time shifted versions of $x_k$ in order to have the number of channels or columns to be $ln$. Here, l is the minimum integer that satisfies $ln > 2m$. Moreover, permuting the order of the measurements provides us with sufficent DMD modes to observe the dyanamics.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{X}_{\text {aug }}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{x}_{1} & \mathbf{x}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-l} \\
\mathbf{x}_{2} & \mathbf{x}_{3} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-l+1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\mathbf{x}_{l} & \mathbf{x}_{l+1} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-1}
\end{array}\right], \\
\\
\mathbf{X}_{\text {aug }}^{\prime}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{x}_{2} & \mathbf{x}_{3} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-l+1} \\
\mathbf{x}_{3} & \mathbf{x}_{4} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-l+2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\mathbf{x}_{l+1} & \mathbf{x}_{l+2} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m}
\end{array}\right] .
\end{array}
$$

The details on how the DMD algorithm will be implemented on the augmented matrices can be found [here](/Ayesha_Moqeet/2021/12/23/DMD_INTRO.html#DMD-Algorithm).

### **Implementation in Python**
---
<br/>

```python
import scipy.io
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy.linalg as la
mat = scipy.io.loadmat('ecog_window.mat')
from numpy import inf
import math   


#Loading and reshaping the data
data = np.loadtxt('data.txt')
X = data.reshape(5, 600)

#paramters
r = 200
nstacks = 240 #2m/n
dt = 0.01

Xaug = np.zeros((360))

for st in range(nstacks):
    b = X[:,st:-1-nstacks+st+1]
    Xaug = np.vstack((Xaug,b))

Xaug = np.delete(Xaug, (0), axis=0)
Xaug.shape

X = Xaug[:,0:-2]
Y = Xaug[:,1:-1]

U,s,Vt = la.svd(X,False)
V = Vt.conj().T
S = np.diag(s)
U_r = U[:,0:r]
S_r = S[0:r, 0:r]
V_r = V[:,0:r]

Atilde = U_r.T @ Y @ V_r @ la.inv(S_r)
D, W_r = la.eig(Atilde)

Phi = Y @ V_r @ la.inv(S_r)@ W_r
k = dt/2*np.pi
omega = np.log10(D)/k

fig = plt.figure(figsize = (13, 5))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)
ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable = 'box')
plt.scatter(D.real, D.imag, s=4, c='black')
circle = plt.Circle((0, 0), 1, color = 'grey', linewidth = 1.5,linestyle = "--", fill = False)
ax.add_patch(circle)
plt.xlabel('Real axis')
plt.ylabel('Imaginary axis')
plt.title('Discrete time Eigenvalues ')
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.scatter(omega.real, omega.imag, s=4, c='black')
plt.axvline(0, linestyle='--', color = 'grey')
plt.xlabel('Real axis')
plt.ylabel('Imaginary axis')
plt.title('Eigen values tranformed to continous time')

plt.xlim(-1)

```
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="{{page.image | relative_url}}" height="300" width="1100"> <figcaption> fig 1 - DMD Eigen values, λ's are  visualized with left being discrete time with respect to unit circle and the right transforming discrete λ's to continuous time with $log(λ)/(2πΔt)$ </figcaption>
</div>

<br/>

According to figure 1 most of the Eigen values either lie on the unit circle or inside it, it indicates that the dynamic modes are oscillatory and decaying and hence are neutrally stable.

### **Comparing DMD spectrum to the Power Spectrum**
---
<br/>

Each dynamic mode is associated with a complex Eigen value. Where the complex part represents the oscillation frequency of the dynamic mode and the real part represents the decay frequency.

The oscillation frequencies of every ith mode, $\phi_i$ can be expressed as following:

$$f_i = w_i^i/2\pi,$$

where $w_i$ is the imaginary part of the complex  DMD Eigen values $\lambda_i$

$$w_i = log(\lambda_i)/\Delta t = w_i^r + iw_i^i.$$

The DMD spectrum is obtained by plotting the sum of *DMD powers* at frequency $f_i$ with respect to the oscillation frequency of the dynamic modes.

The *DMD power* can be calculated by taking the norm squared of $\phi$ and in order to make it comparable to the the power spectrum we scale it. Details can be view here'.

$$P = ||\phi||^2$$

 We plot both DMD Spectrum and Power Spectrum to note the qualitative similarities between the spectrums and as seen in the figure below both have similar amplitude decay frequencies


 <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="{{page.image1| relative_url}}" height="500" width="500"> <figcaption> fig2 - DMD spectrum is constructed using the code below and the image of the image of the power spectrum is by Raphael Vallat via [blog](https://raphaelvallat.com/bandpower.html#)</figcaption>
 </div>

 <br/>
 It is important to note that both spectrums are representative of different aspects and computations were also quite different:

 * Fast Fourier transform was computed for a single channel F3 and DMD was computed on the entire time series data. The oscillation frequencies associated with the dynamic modes do not have a spread that is uniform compared to that of a conventional power spectrum.

 <br/>

 **Advantage of using DMD over FFT**
 <br/>

 DMD modes have straightforward interpretation in the context of analyzing neural signals. Each DMD mode corresponds to a  spatial pattern with coherent dynamics that are dictated by a complex Eigen value.

 Due to the complex natures of the DMD Eigen values it is able to capture decay/growth as well as frequency of oscillation of spatial patterns. This ability, especially to capture growth/decay patterns, plays an essential role in the analysis of transient and non stationary behaviour in signals.
