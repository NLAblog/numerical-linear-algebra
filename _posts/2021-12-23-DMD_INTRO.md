In 2020 nearly 2.5 quintillion bytes worth of data on average was created per day. As the amount of data captured and computed is becoming more advanced,  manipulation of large scale datasets that come along with it has becoming increasingly challenging. In effect the need for *data driven methods* that require minimal supervision which can produce meaningful insights from these high dimensional datasets has escalated.

A large community of  Data driven analysts  turned to Modal Decomposition techniques with the most popular technique used being Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD identifies orthogonal *modes* or orthogonal characteristic features that represent the underlying physics of the data. However, the applications of this decomposition are restricted by its sub optimality in application to non-linear dynamics.

Dynamic Mode decomposition was introduced by Professor Peter Schmidt in 2008 as an effective *equation free* method to reduce dimensionality, analyze and model non linear dynamic systems. The characteristic features of this decomposition are its DMD modes. These modes are  based on the Koopman operator theory which entails that the dynamics of a non linear system can be completely characterized by a set of known modes. Each mode has an associated corresponding eigenvalue which dictate its time dynamics.

In other words, “the DMD converts a dynamical system into a superposition of modes whose dynamics are governed by eigenvalues”.

### **DMD Definition**
---
<br/>
We can define $\mathbf{X}$ as columns of data matrices taken from sequential time series. An example would be measuring the closing price of different stocks over the period of a year. Each snapshot, $\mathbf{x_k}$  would consist of the closing price of stocks of one day and the combined sequential snapshots with $k = 1,2,..n$ of the trading days in the year would then result in $\mathbf{X}$.

We take measurements from *m* points in time and construct two matrices with n x (m-1) dimensions. $\mathbf{X}^{\prime}$ is one time step ahead of $\mathbf{X}$.
<br/>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{X} &=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mid & \mid & & \mid \\
\mathbf{x}_{1} & \mathbf{x}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-1} \\
\mid & \mid & & \mid
\end{array}\right], \\
\mathbf{X}^{\prime} &=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mid & \mid & & \mid \\
\mathbf{x}_{2} & \mathbf{x}_{3} & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m} \\
\mid & \mid & & \mid
\end{array}\right] .
\end{aligned}
$$

<br/>
We assume that there exists a linear operator $\mathbf{A}$ such that

$$
\mathbf{X}^{\prime}=\mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}
$$


We can define the operator $\mathbf{A}$  to be an approximate high dimensional least squares solution to the non linear dynamics of $\mathbf{X}^{\prime}$, $\mathbf{X}$  with $\mathbf{X}^{\dagger}$ being the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $\mathbf{X}$.

$$
\mathbf{A} \approx \mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}^{\dagger}
$$

 *Dynamic Mode Decomposition* in this context can be considered as an approximate Eigen decomposition of operator $\mathbf{A}$. The most direct approach to this would be to compute the SVD of data matrix $\mathbf{X}$

$$\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^{*}$$

Followed by taking the pseudoinverse of $\mathbf{X}$ using the SVD decomposition

 $$\mathbf{A}  \triangleq \mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{U}^{*}$$


The problem arises when $\mathbf{A}$ become an extremely large $n \times n$ matrix.  Taking the Eigen Decomposition of this large matrix becomes computationally expensive.

### **DMD Algorithm**
---

<br/>
DMD Algorithm then proceeds to come in hand as it allows to calculate the *Eigenvalues* and *DMD Modes*  of $\mathbf{A}$ without any explicit computation.

&emsp;*Step 1.*
<br/>

&emsp;Compute the *SVD* of X and truncate it to a lower rank $r$

$$
\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V^{*}}.
$$

&emsp;*Step 2.*

&emsp;Now compute Matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using Pseudoinverse obtained from SVD above

$$
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{V} \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{U}^{*},
$$

&emsp;However, it is more efficent to use rank reduced $r \times r$ matrix $\mathbf{\tilde{A}}$.Which is projection of the full matrix $\mathbf{A}$ onto its *POD* modes also known as the *Koopman matrix*

$$
\mathbf{\tilde{A}}=\mathbf{U^{*}} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{U=U^{*}} \mathbf{X'} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}}.
$$

&emsp;*Step 3.*

&emsp;Eigen Decomposition of $\mathbf{\tilde{A}}$ is then computed with columns of $\mathbf{W}$ as eigenvectors $w_i$ and diagonal components of $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ as eigenvalues $λ_i$

$$
\mathbf{\tilde{A}} \mathbf{W} =\mathbf{W} \mathbf{\Lambda},
$$

&emsp;*Step 4.*

&emsp;Reconstruct the eigendecomposition of A from W and Λ. The eigenvalues for A are equivalent to
&emsp;those of Ã .The eigenvectors of A are given by the columns of Φ:



$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{\Phi} =\mathbf{\Phi} \mathbf{\Lambda}, \quad \mathbf{\Phi}=\mathbf{X'} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}} \mathbf{W}.
$$


### **Example using Python**
---
<br/>
Start by importing and installing all the required packages

{% highlight Python %}
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import cm
%matplotlib inline
from numpy import dot, multiply, diag, power
from warnings import warn
import scipy.io
import numpy.linalg as la
{% endhighlight %}

Next let's generate some non-linear random 3D data and plot it.

```python

#Defining time and space domains
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)
X1,Y1 = np.meshgrid(x,x)
dt = t[2] - t[1]

# Creating three patterns
f = lambda x, y: np.sin(x)* np.cos(x)**2
g = lambda x, y: np.sin(x)**3
h = lambda x, y: np.cos(x)
F = f(X1,Y1)
G = j(X1,Y1)
H = k(X1,Y1)

#Creating noise
noise = np.random.rand(200,200)


#Combining the signals from the data
D = (F+J+K+noise).T

#Creating the DMD matrices
X = D[:,:-1]
Y = D[:,1:]

#Plotting the graphs
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X1,Y1,D.T)
plt.show()

```
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="{{page.image2 | relative_url}}" height="300" width="500"> <figcaption> fig 1 - A plot of a 3D plot with a lot of noise </figcaption>
</div>
<br/>
```python
#svd of the input matrix
U,s,Vt = la.svd(X,False)
V = Vt.conj().T
S = np.diag(s)

#Rank 3 truncation  of the matrix
r = 3
U_r = U[:,0:r]
S_r = S[0:r, 0:r]
V_r = V[:,0:r]

# building  Atilde
Atilde = U_r.T @ Y @ V_r @ la.inv(S_r)
D, W_r = la.eig(Atilde)

#Building the dmd modes
Phi = Y @ V_r @ la.inv(S_r)@ W_r

```
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="{{page.image3 | relative_url}}" height="300" width="500"> <figcaption>fig2 - Eigen Values</figcaption>
</div>
<br/>

- If the Eigen Values are inside the unit circle it means that it's corresponding DMD mode is decaying and is stable.

- While if the Eigen values are outside the unit circle then the corresponding DMD mode is growing and is unstable.

- The imaginary part of Eigen values represents the oscillation frequency of the dynamic mode.

- In the figure above we can see the Eigen value mostly have a nearly zero real part which indicates that the behavior would be that of an undamped oscillator and create plots in time that look sinusoidal. Looking back to our functions the underlying equations are sinusoidal. Therefore, the algorithm was accurate in characterizing the behavior.



<br/>

```python
#Time evolution and Reconstruction
b = la.pinv(Phi) @ X[:,0]
Psi = np.zeros([r, len(t)], dtype='complex')
for i,_t in enumerate(t):
    Psi[:,i] = power(D, _t/dt) * b

D2 = Phi @ Psi

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X1, Y1, D2.real.T)
```
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="{{page.image | relative_url}}" height="300" width="500"> <figcaption> fig 3 - DMD Recreated plot </figcaption>
</div>
